MaRS provides the perfect platform for students to develop their innovative and technical skills such as mechanical, electronics and architectural.
Over the past years, this section has focused more on the 'robotics' part, conducting lectures on microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, etc.; conducting workshops. 
Also, the first year students get a chance to build their bots independently and they are displayed in 'Srishti' ; the Annual Exhibition of Student Technical Club, and attract a lot of appreciation from various professors, and other visitors."

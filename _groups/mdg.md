recruitment: "MDG usually recruits in January, after conclusion of Droid Wars which is a month long competition for freshers during the winter break, organised and judged by MDG.
                         The students are required to work on a few problem statements. At the end of the competition 25-30 students are shotlisted for technical interviews.<br>
                         MDG doesn't expect students to have any knowledge of programming prior to Droid Wars and shortlisting of students is purely based on their performance in Droid Wars. <br>
                         We also have problem statements for Designers and recruit arounf 3-4 students as designers each year.<br>
                         Apart from this, we are are open to scheduling interviews for enthusiastic and deserving students any time of the year and have usually recruited 2-3 students at the end of year as well."

SDSLabs is a student group that constantly tries to innovate and foster technical activities in campus. Our members work in C++, Go, PHP, Ruby, Node.js, Python, sometimes even delving into socket level programming.

We conduct lectures and workshops on all these topics and also conduct monthly competitions on our various self developed applications.

We are highly indebted to Redmine (project managment system), Gitolite (local git managament), Slack (team chat), Dropbox and Google Groups for our functioning.

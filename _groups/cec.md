Civil Engineering Consortium is the departmental group of Civil Engineering Department, IIT Roorkee. The group was established to act as a bridge between the students ( of both, Btech and Mtech programmes) and the faculty.
We at CEC carry out activities all the year round to provide the stage for the budding talent amongst the civilians and also help provide them aid in their academic journey here at IITR and beyond.

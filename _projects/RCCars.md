Students work on a scaled down model of an IC engine car that is remote controlled. The manufacturing and tuning of the components provides a thorough learning of how an IC engine driven vehicle works. 
The team then participates in Powerdrift, the centrestage event at Cognizance-the annual technical fest of IIT Roorkee.
